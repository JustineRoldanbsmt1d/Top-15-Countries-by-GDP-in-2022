<p>GDP per Capita: $1,877</p>
<p>GDP – Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): $8.68 trillion</p>
<p>The Republic of India is a federal democracy that consists of 28 states and 8 union territories. It is the largest democracy and the 6th largest economy in the world. India has thriving manufacturing, technology, and service sectors. Since 2014, the rate of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to India has grown steadily as some key policy changes were incorporated by the government to facilitate this growth. This makes India one of the top countries by GDP in 2022.

Some strategic steps have been taken to stimulate India’s business environment including reforms to remove bottlenecks in key business areas, reducing minimum capital requirement, and simplifying the process of obtaining necessary licenses.</p>
